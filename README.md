Reliably demonstrating the quantum scrambling of information within an interconnected quantum system peaks our interest since it's conjectured to possess an intimate relationship between the quantum system in question and its "holographic dual"; namely, a *black hole*. 

To further probe this exotic quantum regime, we first propose an overview of the available protocols implemented to achieve such a regime. Second, and with help of available simulation tools, we provide notions of an ideal experimental setup (state preparation, evolution and measurement scheme) with which to further access these chaotic information dynamics as well as a physical intuition on what measurements on the quantum system would imply about how black holes process information. 

A detailed mathematical proceeding based on the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal field theory background is presented for this case as well as detailed Python/Qiskit code descriptions which allows us to fully realize the abovementioned dynamics.
