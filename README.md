# QISA
Reliably demonstrating the quantum scrambling of information within an interconnected quantum system peaks our interest since it's conjectured to possess an intimate relationship between the quantum system in question and its "holographic dual"; namely, a *black hole*. 

To further probe this exotic quantum regime, we developed tools in the Qiskit framework which allow us to peer closer into the system's "entanglement dynamics" as it evolves.

Two stages describe our methodology: 

1. Quantum scrambling verification
2. Quantum scrambling analysis

In the first stage we verify that we are capable of producing evolution operators capable of provoking scrambling dynamics in a system. We do so by implementing a novel "_scrambling-conditioned_" quantum teleportation scheme. 

In the second stage, after having verified these dynamics, we aim to further probe the information-dynamics within the system by way of well-known correlators in our quantum circuits. 

Two key figures of merit will be described; one being **scrambling unitaries** and the other **the dlock decomposition method metric**. The former is the main culprit for any information scrambling signature and the former allows us to better categorize randomly-generated scrambling unitaries. 

## We recommend you follow the Demos show in the __Quantum_Scrambling_Verification_test__ folder as well as the showcase found in __QuantumInformationScramblingAnalysis/ScramblingAnalysisShowcase.ipynb__.
